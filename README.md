# PPS-Management-System

## Background:
The P.P.S. Engineering Group offers multidisciplinary engineering consulting and construction services to their clients in Pretoria, South Africa. The consulting services include Civil, Electrical, Chemical, Mechanical and Industrial engineering design and drafting services while the construction services include the implementation and construction of Electrical engineering solutions developed by the Group. 
A typical project involves a client requesting a project proposal and quotation followed by a kick-off meeting if the project is accepted.  The Project is then recorded on a project list with a range of project management markers like progress, resource allocation, expected time of completion, client details, inhouse project lead and so on. The project then runs its course and the project list is then updated as the project progresses. The group conforms to ISO Quality Standards and therefore gives intermittent feedback to the client. The client is then invoiced upon project completion. The company’s main source of revenue is the sale of Engineering Consulting and Project Management hours to their clients as well as on site Electrical engineering construction services.

### Problem Statement:
The existing Project Management system is not automated and does not form part of an integrated workflow system where information input from different stakeholders is required.
This results in poor Project Management capability, poor intra-departmental communication, poor financial analysis capability, poor Executive Management Overview and lack of stakeholder accountability. This also means that regular meaningful reports can’t be generated for Management and Clients.  
The current project management system involves each stakeholder manually entering information on to a Project Management Excel Spreadsheet that is centrally stored on the Company server. This causes several issues:
-	Management can’t pull meaningful scheduled reports from the Project List.
-	The Quality Manager can’t generate regular progress reports for Clients & ISO standards.
-	Mistakes are made when entering information as there is no data input control.
-	Project and client Information is missing as the project list does not form part of an integrated workflow system.
-	Unauthorised access and changes are often made.
-	Finance can’t reliably keep track of payments or reliably budget as missing information and unauthorised changes compromise the information.
-	The project status is not regularly updated as it is not part of the workflow system.
-	Practical issues occur like not more than one person can have the same spreadsheet open at a time.
-	There is a lack of accountability as the Stakeholder roles and information input does not form part of an integrated workflow system.
